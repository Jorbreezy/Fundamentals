Can anyone please help me??? This is the assignment below\n\n**Paragraph:**\n\n**The modern business world goes way beyond the balance sheet. Whether your passion is finance or fashion, economics or the environment, you need an education built for business.**  \n**At Bentley University, we understand this. Sure, we started as an accounting school. But over the past 100 years, the business world has changed and we have too. Today, your classmates are dreaming of Silicon Valley or New York.To contact Bentley's admission office, call 781-891-2244 or 800-523-2354.**\n\nEach line in this file is a paragraph that contains one or more sentences.  Note that each line can be very long!\n\nThe program will provide the following user interaction on the screen:\n\n* Ask the user to enter the name of the input file that contains the document.\n* Ask the user to enter the width of the line in the output file.\n* Ask the user to enter a pattern (e.g., ‘on’).\n* Ask the user for enter a new pattern (e.g., ‘@@’) that is used to replace the old pattern.\n* Ask the user to choose Left/Right/Center justification for the output.\n* Display a message showing the name of the output file written.\n\nThe program will process the input file and create an output file based on its contents, as follows.\n\n·  Create an output file named with the file name of the input file name (e.g., ‘bentley’) followed by “\\_output.txt”.\n\n·  Process the text and find the number of sentences, words, characters, numbers, and phone numbers (in the format of 123-456-7890) in the document, calculate the average sentence length, and write the analysis summary in the output file. **Note that your summary must be grammatically correct.** For example, if the text contains exactly one phone number, the term “phone number” in your summary should be in singular form.  You can assume that the file contains more than one sentence, word, and character. You only need to check for singular/plural on numbers and phone numbers.\n\n·  Write the words “Original Text:” and a line break, followed by each line of original text in lines whose lengths do not exceed the line width specified.  Precede each line written to the file by its line number, in a field of two characters followed by a space.  (You can assume that each file's output will not exceed 99 lines.)  \n\n·  Write two blank lines followed by the words “New Text:” and a line break. \n\n·  Display the processed text again in lines that do not exceed the line width specified. Each line should begin with a line number formatted as above.\n\n·  Each word of the new text is obtained by manipulating the original word: \n\n1.  If a word ends with a comma, period, semicolon, colon, question mark or exclamation mark, remove that character from the word before processing it as described in steps 2, 3, and 4 below.\n\n2.  Replace all the occurrences of the old pattern with the new pattern entered by the user;\n\n3.  If a word’s length is even, reverse the word; otherwise, swap the case of the middle letter (i.e., upper to lower or lower to upper); \n\n4.  Numbers and phone numbers are not altered.\n\n5.  If you \"removed\" a final punctuation mark in step 1, put it back before adding the processed word to the line of output.\n\n·  \"Add\" each word to the next line to be printed. When the line width exceeds the line length specified, write the line to the file preceded by its line number, and with the appropriate justification. \n\n·  Note: As you process the lines of the file, if a line is blank, you need to write the previously processed line with appropriate justification, followed by a blank line in the file, along with their line numbers.\n\n·  Display a message on the screen saying \"{output\\_file} written.\" where {output\\_file} is the name of the output file.\n\n·  See example runs at the end of this document.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1.  Please use the prompts and outputs exactly as shown in the sample interactions.\n\n2.

This is the assignment below&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraph:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The modern business world goes way beyond the balance sheet. Whether your passion is finance or fashion, economics or the environment, you need an education built for business.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;At Bentley University, we understand this. Sure, we started as an accounting school. But over the past 100 years, the business world has changed and we have too. Today, your classmates are dreaming of Silicon Valley or New York.To contact Bentley&amp;#39;s admission office, call 781-891-2244 or 800-523-2354.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each line in this file is a paragraph that contains one or more sentences.  Note that each line can be very long!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The program will provide the following user interaction on the screen:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask the user to enter the name of the input file that contains the document.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask the user to enter the width of the line in the output file.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask the user to enter a pattern (e.g., ‘on’).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask the user for enter a new pattern (e.g., ‘@@’) that is used to replace the old pattern.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ask the user to choose Left/Right/Center justification for the output.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Display a message showing the name of the output file written.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The program will process the input file and create an output file based on its contents, as follows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Create an output file named with the file name of the input file name (e.g., ‘bentley’) followed by “_output.txt”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Process the text and find the number of sentences, words, characters, numbers, and phone numbers (in the format of 123-456-7890) in the document, calculate the average sentence length, and write the analysis summary in the output file. &lt;strong&gt;Note that your summary must be grammatically correct.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if the text contains exactly one phone number, the term “phone number” in your summary should be in singular form.  You can assume that the file contains more than one sentence, word, and character. You only need to check for singular/plural on numbers and phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Write the words “Original Text:” and a line break, followed by each line of original text in lines whose lengths do not exceed the line width specified.  Precede each line written to the file by its line number, in a field of two characters followed by a space.  (You can assume that each file&amp;#39;s output will not exceed 99 lines.)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Write two blank lines followed by the words “New Text:” and a line break. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Display the processed text again in lines that do not exceed the line width specified. Each line should begin with a line number formatted as above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Each word of the new text is obtained by manipulating the original word: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a word ends with a comma, period, semicolon, colon, question mark or exclamation mark, remove that character from the word before processing it as described in steps 2, 3, and 4 below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace all the occurrences of the old pattern with the new pattern entered by the user;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a word’s length is even, reverse the word; otherwise, swap the case of the middle letter (i.e., upper to lower or lower to upper); &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers and phone numbers are not altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &amp;quot;removed&amp;quot; a final punctuation mark in step 1, put it back before adding the processed word to the line of output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  &amp;quot;Add&amp;quot; each word to the next line to be printed. When the line width exceeds the line length specified, write the line to the file preceded by its line number, and with the appropriate justification. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Note: As you process the lines of the file, if a line is blank, you need to write the previously processed line with appropriate justification, followed by a blank line in the file, along with their line numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  Display a message on the screen saying &amp;quot;{output_file} written.&amp;quot; where {output_file} is the name of the output file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;·  See example runs at the end of this document.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please use the prompts and outputs exactly as shown in the sample interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A different input file will be used when your program is graded, so be sure your program is general enough to handle any text file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your program must be able to handle errors&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., pattern not found, and/or invalid letter for justification, or an invalid line length).

In a world so immersed in technology, it’s sometimes hard to tell what was truly real and what was just a projection of a computer. \n\nAfter the Monster Harvest fiasco of 2012, the government decided that all video games and technological add ons would be mass surveyed and circulated, so nothing too triggering or intense could ever be allowed to the public again in such a capacity. Under-the-table amature softwares quickly dubbed as “challenges” emerged soon afterwards, most on a small scale to provide the graphic experience fantic virtual reality users so desired.\n\nThe 2020 Challenge is not the newest challenge, but by far the most popular. It is tossed around first as a classroom rumor, similar to the whispers of a ghost hiding behind the mirror after dark and the monsters that lurked in the woods. When one downloads the file for the 2020 Challenge, the first thing that will flash across a black screen in red, lowercase, arial script will read “are you sure?” then it will ask you to check the box of yes or no. It’s said that about 50% decide to click no and the software shuts down, unable to be opened again unless you redownloaded the application. The rest click yes, and what comes next is up to debate. \n\nLike most stories passed around purely in hushed conversations, there was no set story about what the game actually entailed. The virtual reality is said to suck you into this world of the 2020 Challenge, the anonymous creator’s perception of hell. That is, until the year of 2018, when the challenge got mass media coverage. Screenshots of the game began flooding websites like Reddit and Discord in an unexplainable surge in popularity, leaving the poor souls who saw it not only terrified but greatly intrigued. Incredibly religious folk and conspiracy theorists alike started questioning if the players using the software were actually being transported to hell.\n\nOn April 4th, 2018, 22 year old Matt Bryd was found in a marsh located in Florida, completely naked and his feet and legs were covered in fourth degree burns. He was alive, although barely, with his eyes rolled back in his head. News coverage reports that he was, at minimum, there for 2 days and at maximum, was found after a week. A small family known only to the media as the Marshals who lived near the marsh went out on the lake for gator hunting, finding the man floating chest up. \n\nWhen they got Mr. Bryd and brought him back to his house, ambulances on the way, it seemed as though something was not quite right. His eyes were wild and when the Marshals had guided him to a rocking chair on the porch, he started rocking frantically. He spoke as if he didn’t have enough time to say what he wanted to say, words falling atop of each other as he quickly recounted on how he had finished the 2020 Challenge and lost, but then after that things got much stranger. When he was treated in the hospital, he spoke gibberish. It took weeks for the nurses and doctors to figure out exactly what was wrong with him, and even now as he resides in a Floridan psychiatric hospital, no one can make sense of his condition.\n\nOn April 19th, 2018, 19 year old Emily Spearman in Utah had a similar experience. Her roommates and friends report she played the 2020 Challenge casually, quitting a few months earlier at the quarter point in the game, but then picking it up once again a few weeks prior to her becoming of interest. Her friends claim that once she picked the game back up again, her behavior started becoming unlike her. The once laid back, 3.7 GPA college student became frantic and paranoid, constantly talking to herself in hushed voices and sparing accusing glances at all who passed. She was with her roommates late one night, the three of them tripping on psychedelics, when she decided to go into her room and try to finish the game off. It was a few hours later when the sun came up and they decided to see if she wanted to walk with them to McDonalds, where they found her completely naked on her bed, staring at the roof with her feet in a similar horrific condition as Mr. Bryd. \n\nHer friends, although perhaps not in the best mindspace for this situation, screamed and called the police, and the only thing Miss. Spearman repeated calmly that “I lost.” In custody, an odd tic developed. It started in her hands, flicking her fingers up and down erratically without pause. The tics spread to her face, twitching her face inwards of itself with one-sided blinking that was intune to the music playing in the background of the 2020 Challenge software. Like Mr. Byrd, her speech dissolved into an unintelligible bungled expression. Now, she spends her days strapped down to her chair in her white hospital room as she becomes a threat to herself, intent on clawing at her own skin until blood bubbles to the surface. She stares blankly out the window, drool dripping down her face and onto her lap.\n\nThe government began to take steps to take down the application, but it had been passed down so many times through so many files that it seemed rather impossible. It’s unclear whether or not the government is still putting action towards dissolving the program.\n\nIn classic human nature, the negative attention pushed people to wanting to complete the game and the application got a surge in downloads. Every few weeks at least one case of a person with their feet burned explained that they had lost the game and wound up in the hospital. People who didn’t quite make it through the game also began getting attention. It became obvious that even if you do not complete and finish the game, horrific things would occur. Stories of people setting whole forests on fire in the name of the Challenge emerged, along with the surge in Gen Z and Millenial suicide rates. When police looked deeper into the motivation of these young people to take their own lives, notes left behind and close people around them tearfully explained their obsession with the 2020 Challenge, and how their happy personas cracked under the tragedy the game was putting them through. \n\nIn a year, people began understanding the crimes that must be behind the software and dipped the media attention and people stopped making it far in the game. Unofficial game reports show that all players after the year point of the media popularity stop playing the game by the halfway point. \n\nOn August 29th, 2020, a youtube channel by the name of piercetheash uploaded “2020 Challenge Let’s Play, Part 1.” This intrigued viewers and practically immediately gained viral attention. Hopefully, this playthrough will bring insight into what the game is, and claims to continue the uploads in the coming weeks. \n\nAshley wrapped her blanket tighter around her shoulders, her back pressed against the wall. She snipped and unsnapped her scissors in her hands, the metal reflecting the dull light of her overhead lamp. The childish habit of not wanting her back exposed to the things that lurked in the dark was one that began manifesting itself again in her everyday life. She hadn’t realized it at first, but sleeping any other way now was impossible.\n\nThe 2020 Challenge had always interested the amature gamer. In 2018, she had made an offshoot promise to her 54k subscribers that in 2020 she would record a playthrough of the horrifying challenge. She decided quite obstinately after the hospitalization of Emily Spearman, however, that she would never play the VR game, let alone upload it. As her senior year approached, she wasn’t quite so sure anymore. Ashley was hauled up in her house with her parents and younger brother for her senior year, missing out on all the senior benefits and activities she should be experiencing. In the end, the teenager decided to mess around with the software and see where it took her. \n\nThat was the worst decision of her short life. \n\nThe scratching is the first thing that followed her from the game. That scratching. That goddamn scratching. \n\nThe second was the groans. The groans, like the whispering, followed her from inside the walls of her house. The thing that was haunting her was on the verge of becoming completely palpable, and what she could hear from it was the horrific sound of rage clawing its way up its throat and ripping through the air in short, furious outbursts. In reflection, the groaning was the thing that was easiest to ignore.\n\nThe banging comes next. Sometimes it’s dull and lazy. In fact, often it is. On particularly bad days, the banging clings to her insides like black, bubbling sludge. With each step Ashley takes, the sludge grows heavier and heavier until she’s on her hands and knees crawling to her destination, the banging repeating in a demonic harmony nuzzled against her temples. \n\nAnd then the whispering. The whispering is less common, but one of the worst. The whispering, when she is awake, is incoherent; backwards. Sideways, maybe, or upside down. Ashley doesn’t care, it doesn’t make sense to her, anyway. When she’s asleep, she dreams silently. Images of a man’s mouth unhinged in an inaudible scream, his face covered in soot and blood. The whites of his eyes are red and bloody. The skin on his hands is melting off, white and thick and mangled. Depictions of a girl strapped to a medical table in a completely white room. She didn’t need to hear the screams of agony that ripped from her lungs--it was written all over her body. Deep slits start appearing on her near naked body from the inside out. Images of fire swim in front of her eyes. Sometimes it’s surrounding Ashley, other times she’s on the outskirts. The fire is so hot that when it licks against her skin it’s cold. White flashes behind her eyes and the ground is lapping closer to her face. The only sound that follows her through these dreams of decay are faint whispers that suffocate her. These whispers, though, are coherent, heeding warnings on if she didn’t finish the game, a fate worse than death would follow her. \n\nMaybe the whispers held some truth.\n\nThe scratching is the worst. The scratching isn’t something she could avoid because it’s in the walls, or in her dreams. She can’t chug a pot of coffee or steal her brother’s Modafinil to force herself awake. She can’t put on her Beats headphones or go on long drives to keep herself distracted. The scratching is unavoidable. It comes from inside her. The scratching is constant. It does not take breaks. \n\nThe scratching came in the form of a particularly annoying monstrosity that she encountered lurking in the files of the 2020 Challenge. It had latched onto her avatar in game and she noticed a few playthroughs later that the scratching she began hearing in real life was coming from her own body outwards. \n\nLast week, Ashley wiped her entire harddrive of her computer. All of the files of the surplus of games she had installed on her $2000 PC were erased. With her weak arms, she managed to shove her PC from her third story window. Her mother was outside at the time, working in her garden, when the sound of her daughter’s incredibly expensive system slammed against the pavement, an outlandishly loud crashing sound ripping through the air. The rainbow, glowing keyboard crashed against the ground a beat after.\n\nHer anger was the least of Ashley’s worries.\n\nShe had deleted her YouTube channel, along with all her videos. She erased her Instagram and Twitter, and she only used her phone now to prowl in the YouTube forums to copyright claim any reuploads of her playthroughs she had wiped off the internet, particularly ones of the 2020 Challenge. \n\nKnowing that she herself must have influenced so many people to indulge in the game themselves filled her with shards of glass. Ashley can not stop the sun, make time slow down. She can only watch with dread as it dragged her into the next day.\n\nSitting with her back against the wall, her eyelids heavy, she clipped the scissors once more. The scratching today was content at poking up at her skin in her left forearm, the digging against flesh swirling in her mind.\n\nAshley unhinged her scissors, pressing her four fingers in the middle of the blades and rubbed her thumb against the plastic backing. She flexed her forearm, the scratching keeping up its steady pace. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before stabbing the metal end into her flesh. The pain was sharp and sudden, the blood splattering against her face, and before her brain could stop her, she was dragging the scissors through her skin as if it was the paper she used every year to wrap Christmas presents. A long, deep gash stared back at her. \n\nThe scratching was against her thigh, now. She jumped off her bed to stand.\n\nContortorting her body to get the best possible angle, she raised the scissors high and then plunged them down into her thigh. This time the skin was harder to penetrate, but she stabbed at the area more furiously until the smell of iron that wafted from the wound was satisfying.\n\nThe scratching ran throughout her body, Ashley not hesitating to carve into her body with the Michaels scissors. The squish of her flash once the blade penetrated her flesh became almost comforting to her. She began twisting the blade in her hands, watching her own skin turn to shreds as she turned the scissors, the sound of her muscles and nerves being mutilated growing louder. \n\nShe was heaving against the floor, her head pounding, every cell in her body screaming for oxygen. The scissors lay splattered with blood against the wooden floor. The blood is cold, now. Her hands were covered in sticky iron, scarlet fluid dripping out from her depraved body. For some reason, it doesn’t hurt as much as she thought it would. \n\nThere it was again. The fucking scratching. In her head, just behind her eyes, the scratching started again. She dragged her eyes to look over at the abandoned scissors. The muscles throughout her arm stretched and ached awkwardly and she gasped on air until her fingers limply twisted around the scissors once again. \n\nAshley heaved her body as silently as possible across the ground towards her mirror. Her hands were shaking so badly it was hard to keep up the movement. Her mirror, glued against the wall and close to the ground, was a godsend. When she was a few inches away, her eyes lingered on what she had become. She had purposely avoided her reflection for weeks now, terrified that she may see something she wasn’t ready to face. Now she was thankful she was waiting till now to evaluate the damage.\n\nHer once dark hair became white at the roots, her natural golden skin has sunken in tone to something lifeless. The freckles that once littered her skin were all but faint speaks, her hazel eyes practically black. The bags under her eyes were shiny and heavy, her lips cracked and scarlet. Her skin was covered in gashes and stab wounds, the blood splattering all exposed whiteness. She looked tired. \n\nAshley gripped her fingers tightly around the plastic scissors, so tightly that her knuckles became white. She leaned against the wall to ease herself up, and this time she did call out in agony. Her breath caught on a choke as she hoisted herself on her knees. \n\nThe creature just beyond the walls raised in volume. As it paced just beyond the veil of reality she found herself in, its nails dragging against the floor, its groaning becoming wails. As the sound grew louder and louder, it seemed to encompass every corner of her mind, pushing out all and everything that wasn’t itself.\n\nThe banging from inside the walls of her room picked up. With each enraged slam the sound forced itself into her consciousness, rattling her bones. Her spine contorted painfully in rhythm to the persistent clobbering. Her legs grew heavy with ink, and she rolled her head backwards to ease the tension of her body slowly shutting down.\n\nBackwards whispering came in and out of the background noises, twisting and unwinding between coherent and demonic. The words that shoved its way through the slamming enclosing around her were *do it* and *now*. \n\nAshley flexed her back straight. Her whole body felt sluggish and heavy but as she narrowed her gaze at her horribly disfigured arms, the flesh open and oozing, she knew what had to be done. She brought the scissors above her head, took a shaky inhale, and then stabbed the blades into her eyes.\n\nThe scratching doesn’t stop.","author_fullname":"t2_vkk790b","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"2020 Challenge","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/nosleep","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_jamy8p","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.5,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":0,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":["writing"],"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1602653442,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.nosleep","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2020 Challenge emerged, perhaps, as a protest to popular government programs.

It had latched onto her avatar in game and she noticed a few playthroughs later that the scratching she began hearing in real life was coming from her own body outwards. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last week, Ashley wiped her entire harddrive of her computer. All of the files of the surplus of games she had installed on her $2000 PC were erased. With her weak arms, she managed to shove her PC from her third story window. Her mother was outside at the time, working in her garden, when the sound of her daughter’s incredibly expensive system slammed against the pavement, an outlandishly loud crashing sound ripping through the air. The rainbow, glowing keyboard crashed against the ground a beat after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her anger was the least of Ashley’s worries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had deleted her YouTube channel, along with all her videos. She erased her Instagram and Twitter, and she only used her phone now to prowl in the YouTube forums to copyright claim any reuploads of her playthroughs she had wiped off the internet, particularly ones of the 2020 Challenge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing that she herself must have influenced so many people to indulge in the game themselves filled her with shards of glass. Ashley can not stop the sun, make time slow down. She can only watch with dread as it dragged her into the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sitting with her back against the wall, her eyelids heavy, she clipped the scissors once more. The scratching today was content at poking up at her skin in her left forearm, the digging against flesh swirling in her mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley unhinged her scissors, pressing her four fingers in the middle of the blades and rubbed her thumb against the plastic backing. She flexed her forearm, the scratching keeping up its steady pace. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before stabbing the metal end into her flesh. The pain was sharp and sudden, the blood splattering against her face, and before her brain could stop her, she was dragging the scissors through her skin as if it was the paper she used every year to wrap Christmas presents. A long, deep gash stared back at her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The scratching was against her thigh, now. She jumped off her bed to stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contortorting her body to get the best possible angle, she raised the scissors high and then plunged them down into her thigh. This time the skin was harder to penetrate, but she stabbed at the area more furiously until the smell of iron that wafted from the wound was satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The scratching ran throughout her body, Ashley not hesitating to carve into her body with the Michaels scissors. The squish of her flash once the blade penetrated her flesh became almost comforting to her. She began twisting the blade in her hands, watching her own skin turn to shreds as she turned the scissors, the sound of her muscles and nerves being mutilated growing louder. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was heaving against the floor, her head pounding, every cell in her body screaming for oxygen. The scissors lay splattered with blood against the wooden floor. The blood is cold, now. Her hands were covered in sticky iron, scarlet fluid dripping out from her depraved body. For some reason, it doesn’t hurt as much as she thought it would. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There it was again. The fucking scratching. In her head, just behind her eyes, the scratching started again. She dragged her eyes to look over at the abandoned scissors. The muscles throughout her arm stretched and ached awkwardly and she gasped on air until her fingers limply twisted around the scissors once again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley heaved her body as silently as possible across the ground towards her mirror. Her hands were shaking so badly it was hard to keep up the movement. Her mirror, glued against the wall and close to the ground, was a godsend. When she was a few inches away, her eyes lingered on what she had become. She had purposely avoided her reflection for weeks now, terrified that she may see something she wasn’t ready to face. Now she was thankful she was waiting till now to evaluate the damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her once dark hair became white at the roots, her natural golden skin has sunken in tone to something lifeless. The freckles that once littered her skin were all but faint speaks, her hazel eyes practically black. The bags under her eyes were shiny and heavy, her lips cracked and scarlet. Her skin was covered in gashes and stab wounds, the blood splattering all exposed whiteness. She looked tired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley gripped her fingers tightly around the plastic scissors, so tightly that her knuckles became white. She leaned against the wall to ease herself up, and this time she did call out in agony. Her breath caught on a choke as she hoisted herself on her knees. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creature just beyond the walls raised in volume. As it paced just beyond the veil of reality she found herself in, its nails dragging against the floor, its groaning becoming wails. As the sound grew louder and louder, it seemed to encompass every corner of her mind, pushing out all and everything that wasn’t itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The banging from inside the walls of her room picked up. With each enraged slam the sound forced itself into her consciousness, rattling her bones. Her spine contorted painfully in rhythm to the persistent clobbering. Her legs grew heavy with ink, and she rolled her head backwards to ease the tension of her body slowly shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Backwards whispering came in and out of the background noises, twisting and unwinding between coherent and demonic. The words that shoved its way through the slamming enclosing around her were &lt;em&gt;do it&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley flexed her back straight. Her whole body felt sluggish and heavy but as she narrowed her gaze at her horribly disfigured arms, the flesh open and oozing, she knew what had to be done. She brought the scissors above her head, took a shaky inhale, and then stabbed the blades into her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The scratching doesn’t stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rm4d","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"jamy8p","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"blprince","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/nosleep/comments/jamy8p/2020_challenge/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jamy8p/2020_challenge/","subreddit_subscribers":14367757,"created_utc":1602624642,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"DaystromInstitute","selftext":"So, I’m running a Star Trek RPG campaign with some friends of mine that is also a [podcast/audio drama](http://starshiptempest.com/). It’s set in the Lost Era about 25 years before the start of TNG, so to get a sense of what the right registry numbers would be for the time period, I created this [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPkpJCW0FgjV_8k8girwhVpk25U-pLrt/view?usp=sharing) and plotted out the registries over time from the founding of the Federation up through the 2380s, making sure they conformed to all known canon instances and - as much as possible - licensed non-canon instances as well.\n\nYou can play around with it yourself by adjusting the different factors: Addition (how many ships were ordered each year), the fleet’s overall attrition rate (which would include all types of ships removed from active service - destroyed, lost, retired, decommissioned, etc.), and the number of UFP member worlds and sectors of space (I assume that the UFP adds about one member or protectorate every year and one sector of territory every other year).\n\nIn the process of putting this together, I developed a theory (actually two) about why the registry numbers skyrocket between the TOS and TNG eras. First, some assumptions:\n\n1. Each starship receives a unique number with one of several predetermined prefixes (NX, NCC, NAR, NST, etc.), which combine to form that starship’s registry.\n2. No starships are ever assigned the same number (with one very notable exception and that one gets a letter suffix). For example, there would never be one ship with the registry NCC-74656 and another with NST-74656.\n3. Registry numbers are assigned sequentially (we’ll refer to this as the “registry number stream” moving forward).\n4. Registry numbers are assigned when a starship is ordered by Starfleet Command, not when its construction starts, finishes, when it's launched, officially commissioned, or any other event.\n5. The time between when a starship is ordered and when it’s launched (if it’s ever launched at all) can vary greatly depending on several factors, including but not limited to:\n   1. A prototype versus a standard design\n   2. The number of ships ahead of it in the ordering queue\n   3. Other logistical factors, etc. For example, the TNG Tech Manual mentions six Galaxy space frames that were started but intentionally left half completed for an indeterminate period of time. These space frames would’ve received registry numbers at the time they were ordered, even though the ships may not have entered service until several years after the fact.\n6. The rate of registry number increases starts to rise dramatically sometime around 2320 (based on [this analysis](http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/articles/registry-chart2.gif) by Ex Astris Scientia).\n\n# My Theory:\n\nIn the early 2320s, Starfleet realized something fairly simple, though not necessarily immediately obvious: its main bottleneck in the maximum fleet size it could field didn’t have anything to do with how quickly or how many ships it could build. Not by the amount of raw materials available for construction, by construction time needed, or the throughput capacity of its shipyards. In fact, the upper limit on Starfleet’s capacity for fielding ships was not related to ship production at all. Instead, it was how quickly it could train new officers and crew to staff those starships. Since the Federation had already unequivocally turned away from genetic and cybernetic enhancement, the lowest logistical ceiling was the four years needed to train an officer to a minimum proficiency. And then another 10-15 years at least to train that officer to a command ability.\n\nAt the same time, Starfleet also knew that someday the unthinkable was bound to happen - someday, somebody would launch a large scale invasion of Federation space. Whether it would be the Klingons, Romulans, the recently encountered Cardassians, or some as yet unknown species, Starfleet couldn’t guess. But it knew that this was an eventuality it had to be prepared for.\n\nSo in the early 2320s, they decided to simultaneously both prepare for and create a deterrence for that eventuality by building a surplus of starships that would essentially go straight into mothballs, but which could be reactivated and pressed into service in as little as a few days. Starfleet would start steadily building a tactical advantage that would only grow stronger over time. From that point forward, Starfleet started running all of its shipyards at 100% capacity at all times, despite knowing full well that this would create ten times or more as many ships as they had officers to crew them. They were mostly tried and true designs: Mirandas, Excelsiors, Oberths and most of them, upon completion, were quietly flown to any number of a hundred different surplus yards spread across the entirety of Federation space. Whereupon they were powered down and stripped of their dilithium crystals, torpedo inventories, and phaser coils.\n\nWhen Shelby says in *Best of Both Worlds* that they’ll have the fleet back up and running in less than a year, she doesn’t mean they’re going to build 40 ships from scratch and launch them all within that time. She means that they’re going to dip into the Reserve Surplus - reactivate them, reassign officers to staff them, and have them filling the holes in the deployment profile that Wolf 359 left behind.\n\nFurther, when the Dominion War breaks out, Starfleet suffers continuous heavy casualties for months - hundreds of ships are damaged or destroyed in the war’s early days. And that’s even before we ever see the 1000+ ship battles that the *Defiant* later participates in. We can reconcile this with a “small” Starfleet by supposing that the bulk of those ships were being reactivated from surplus yards and staffed as quickly as possible, but that they were not on active operational duty prior to being pressed into combat. It also explains why there are so many *Miranda*\\-class in the Dominion fleets. It's not because the bulk of Starfleet is *Miranda*\\-class, it's because the bulk of the Reserve Fleet is *Miranda*\\-class, because that's what was politically viable when the Reserve Fleet first started taking shape.\n\nThis can also help explain the Enterprise-E’s absence for the visible parts of the Dominion War - if the DS9 fleets were largely made up of Reserve Surplus ships, then that lessens the need for otherwise “regular” starships to be present in those fleets. It makes more sense why a ship like the Enterprise-E would continue in her normal operations while there are these great assemblages of fleets otherwise fighting in coordinated campaigns.\n\nThe Galaxy-class ships we see in DS9’s fleet battles are probably an exception to this rule and are likely active-duty ships that serve as the nuclei to groups of Reserve Fleet ships (i.e. Galaxy wings 9-1 and 9-3), much the way aircraft carriers serve as the nuclei of modern day naval carrier groups.\n\n**Objection 1**: But then why doesn’t Shelby explicitly mention the Reserve Surplus when she talks about rebuilding the fleet? How does it never come up during all the conversations between characters during the Dominion War?\n\nIt’s true that the general existence of the policy would be hard to keep a secret, especially once war time actually came. To limit that liability, Starfleet officers would be explicitly discouraged from discussing the details and specifics of it - something which only admirals, their adjutants, and maybe some captains would do only when absolutely necessary. For your run of the mill officer that ends up assigned to that ship, they would only really be aware of the fact that they’ve been assigned to the *USS Lee* (NCC-31450). If it ever even occurred to them to be curious about the ship’s service history, official records might only say something terse and generic like “Reactivated from Reserve Status on Stardate 50534.1.”\n\n**Objection 2**: But how can it be a secret at all when there are hundreds of starships flying around with 7xxxx registry numbers painted on their hulls, plain as day? Why wouldn’t they use some separate registry stream or no registry at all to hide the reserve fleet’s existence?\n\nI imagine that when the Reserve Surplus policy was first proposed and then committed to, more than one admiral asked this exact question. And to avoid the problem, the admirals seriously considered giving the surplus ships a different registry code format, which would limit the rise of registry numbers in the regular service ships the other powers were likely to encounter. But ultimately, they decided against it to avoid some thorny diplomatic issues that would result:\n\nStarfleet prides itself on its multi-role mission. It doesn’t make warships and science ships. It makes starships, which are supposed to be able to serve either function. Giving the Reserve Fleet a distinctive registry code format would’ve been a tacit admission of its more cynical purpose - that those ships really were built and stored solely for the purpose of waging war. Even though the Federation would never use such a resource for a preemptive invasion, its potential enemies wouldn’t be so trusting, and they might then have used the special registry code as evidence of Starfleet’s hostility (the term “secret invasion fleet” would undoubtedly be thrown around). So, in the end and to avoid diplomatic objections, Starfleet kept its deceptively straightforward chronological number scheme and let starships fly around with registry numbers that gave the game away.\n\nMoreover, even though it may have been the policy’s original impetus, these ships weren’t meant for just defense against invasion. They were ultimately meant to be drawn upon for any purpose and therefore, they had to be as capable of fulfilling all of a starship’s potential mission profiles as any other ship. And their registries, the Admiralty decided, should reflect that.\n\nAll of which combined to create a situation where the Reserve Surplus policy became paradoxically both one of Starfleet’s most closely guarded secrets and an open secret among all of the great powers of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants.\n\nSure enough, by the 2330’s, the other powers started noticing the rapid rise in starship registry numbers. And when they started extrapolating those numbers, they quickly realized there were hundreds and then thousands of ships they weren’t seeing. At first, they weren’t sure where they were or what they were doing. Space is, after all, quite a big place and no spacefaring power has the ability to effectively surveil the entirety of another power’s territory. When accused, Federation diplomats feigned ignorance. When confronted with evidence, they neither confirmed nor denied anything and the consistent registry format kept that denial credible, if not believable. But in all that was unspoken, a very clear message was sent: the Federation will never seek war. But if pressed, it was prepared for it.\n\nThe Klingons provide an illustrative and perhaps the most important example of how this deterrence worked in practice. At the policy’s inception, peace with the Klingons was still a relatively new situation. The Federation wanted to maintain that peace and build upon it, but at the same time, it also needed to be prepared in case that peace failed. The Reserve Surplus policy accomplished the second goal at the cost of the first. The Admiralty feared that the Klingons might even decide it constituted an invasion fleet and use that as justification in attacking first. In the wake of Praxis, had the Klingons started that war, they would’ve lost it. But the Federation avoids wars, even when it can win them. But even so the Federation couldn’t fully trust the Klingons to honor that peace, the bad blood running too deep for too long. By building the Reserve Surplus and using familiar designs like the *Miranda* and *Oberth*, as well as keeping them within the same registry scheme as operational starships, Starfleet was able to walk a fine line of being prepared for war without outright courting it. And, in part because of the deterrence created by the Reserve Surplus policy, war with the Klingons never came (though of course there were other factors, the most significant being the sacrifice of the *Enterprise-C*, which began to genuinely sway Klingon public opinion towards the Federation in a way that no other outreach had been able to do).\n\nOn the other hand, even despite their general knowledge of it, the Reserve Surplus was not enough to dissuade the Cardassians from going to war. They poured the majority of their economy into their war efforts once the conflict kicked into high gear in the 2350s. And for ten years, the Cardassians produced as many ships as they could as fast as they could, strip mining both their own planet and those of annexed territories like Bajor in the process. But despite a single minded focus on military superiority, they simply could not overcome the seemingly inexhaustible supply of replacement ships that Starfleet was able to field. Whenever the Cardassians managed to destroy a starship, it was replaced within weeks, sometimes days. Nonetheless, the Cardassians were relentless in their efforts. Where Klingons on the battlefield might be summed up with the word “ferocity” or Romulans with the word “cunning”, Cardassians could be summed up with the word “tenacity.” For ten years and with an uncommon single-mindedness, the Cardassians threw their focused might on defeating Starfleet and acquiring Federation territory. And though they made some little gains here and there, the Reserve Surplus policy created a logistical wall that they simply could not breach, to the point where Starfleet was able to demobilize from a war footing a full three years before the Cardassians did. Eventually, even they realized that the pursuit of such gains at Starfleet’s expense was an ultimately futile effort, paving the way for an eventual armistice.\n\n**Objection 3**: But if the bottleneck is trained officers, that still doesn’t explain how Starfleet staffs those ships when war does come.\n\nYes, this is true. So let’s stretch this theory a bit further and also use it to explain the officer/enlisted situation. We know that enlisted crew ranks exist, but seem to be extraordinarily rare compared against present day militaries. Gene Roddenberry may at one point have had a vision of a Starfleet with only officers, but that’s now patently contradicted by on screen evidence, Miles O’Brien being the most substantial example (but others existing as well, like Crewman Tarses).\n\nSo how do we reconcile this? This is how:\n\nIn peace time, Starfleet maintains an officer corps with at least four years of training, usually from Starfleet Academy, and enough to fully staff a “small” fleet for exploratory, humanitarian, and defensive patrol missions. In peacetime, this mostly suffices. Starfleet also maintains a small corps of enlisted personnel, but this is mostly just to retain the institutional memory of how to train and field enlisted personnel at all. In peace time, enlisted ranks make up a very small percentage of overall Starfleet personnel.\n\nBut should Starfleet have to transition into a wartime footing, it can use that institutional memory to rapidly train tens of thousands of enlisted crewmembers in the bare essentials of starship operations within the span of a few months. As Starfleet mobilizes for war, it activates its Reserve Surplus fleet and spreads out its Academy trained officer corps over the entirety of Starfleet, with enlisted personnel filling up the bottom ranks of operations. The enlisted crewmember takes the station that would normally go to a newly commissioned ensign (or even a Starfleet Academy cadet on field training).\n\n(we'll leave aside the question of where these extra bodies come from, whether the Federation would institute a draft or in some other way compel a larger percent of the population to participate in war making. I think it's an interesting question and one I'd like to explore at some point, but I don't have any formed thoughts at the moment)\n\nIn peacetime, that ensign might be the low-person on the operations department totem pole, scrubbing plasma conduits on a long serving starship without anyone under their supervision. But in wartime, that same ensign might find their first assignment is onboard an activated Reserve Surplus ship, overseeing one or more enlisted personnel with three to six months of department-specific training, much more similar to how current-day militaries function. Starfleet doesn’t consider it an ideal situation, preferring its personnel to be more well rounded. But it’s an acceptable compromise to make in order to wield the most effective fighting force possible, as long as that compromise is a temporary one.\n\n(we can also use this theory to put one more notch into Ensign Kim’s butt monkey status - had he commissioned just a bit later, he would’ve done so into a Starfleet mobilized for the Dominion War. Whereupon he might’ve been immediately in charge of some amount of enlisted personnel. Even if he was still just an ensign, at least he wouldn’t have been at the absolute bottom of the ladder. But alas, poor Harry missed it by *that* much!)\n\nOnce the conflict concludes and Starfleet is able to demobilize from a wartime footing, most of those enlisted personnel are deactivated along with the Reserve Surplus ships they staffed. Some few may choose to stay in the service and almost all of those go through further training to become commissioned officers. Some exceedingly few may choose to stay in the service but not go through officer training and become non-commissioned officers. This is how we explain Chief O’Brien: he originally enlisted as part of the Cardassian Wars and was able to rise at least as far as Tactical Officer on a *New Orleans*\\-class ship. After Starfleet demobilized (though before the official armistice was signed), he chose to stay on but also chose not to transition into a commissioned officer, perhaps one of only a very few to do so. From what we know of him, we can surmise he liked the opportunities to work on interesting machinery, but never had any interest in commanding a starship or one of its departments, and thus never applied to the Academy before enlisting nor pursued an officer’s commission following the war. To remain a Tactical Officer/Chief of Security would've required becoming a commissioned officer and department head. He didn't care about any of that, so he moved to transporters and was perfectly content there until an opportunity came along to work on an even more interesting engineering challenge - cobbling together a monstrosity of Starfleet and Cardassian technology. The attraction of that challenge might've overwhelmed his aversion to becoming a department head with people under his command.\n\nSo my supposition is that enlisted crewmen are uncommon but not rare, but if one stays in Starfleet long enough, the natural course is to go through officer training and receive a commission. One has to make an active choice to stay in Starfleet for an extended period of time but remain an NCO rather than become an officer, making NCOs legitimately rare. This is based on the observation that we have only seen two Chief Petty Officers in all of Star Trek: Miles O'Brien and Sergey Rozchenko, both of whom expressed an explicit preference to remain enlisted rather than become officers.\n\n# Special Bonus Theory: The Starship Registration Reorganization Act\n\nEven with this theory, we’re still talking about an awful lot of ships - between one and two thousand every year for decades upon decades. So, I actually have a second theory on registry numbers that I use in tandem with the Reserve Surplus theory. Though it’s much duller and doesn’t offer any of the diplomatic intrigue that the Reserve Surplus theory does, it does do yeoman’s work in lifting the yearly average. And it’s not really linked to the Reserve Surplus theory by necessity, so you can feel free to take either one and leave the other if you choose.\n\nAnyway, it goes like this:\n\nAlso in the early 2320s, the Federation Council passed into law the Starship Registry Reorganization Act, significantly altering how registry numbers were managed and folding the administration of vessel registry, civilian and Starfleet, under one common office and therefore, into one stream of registry numbers. Starfleet, as we all know, serves a broader role than just military or defense and in practice probably handles many of the duties that a present day government’s “alphabet soup” of offices does. To draw a parallel to present day organizations, Starfleet is both the Navy and NASA. But beyond that, it’s also the Coast Guard, NOAA, and probably the FAA, NTSB, CTB, ATF, DEA, and several others.\n\nIn the 20th/21st century United States, the Navy assigns hull numbers to Navy vessels while the Coast Guard maintains registries for civilian vessels. Similarly, the various service branches assign tail codes to their own aircraft while the FAA assigns and manages tail numbers for all civilian aircraft. But if all of the future versions of these disparate offices fall under the general umbrella of Starfleet, then it makes sense that those individual functions would also be consolidated into a single office.\n\n(in real life, you apply for the tail number you want and the FAA gives it to you if available. But we’ll dispense with that part in this analogy, both to keep the sequential registry framework intact and to avoid the prospect of starship vanity plates. Instead, we’ll say that if you’re building a starship for non-Starfleet purposes, Starfleet just hands you the next number in the stream)\n\nSo in this construct, prior to the 2320s, Starfleet maintained a simple stream of numbers that they applied only to their own ship registries. And since each vessel was supposed to be all purpose - in theory capable of both exploration and defense - they dispensed with type-specific registry codes and kept only a distinction between prototype and operational vessels. In other words, instead of the BB-62, CVN-65, SSN-688, etc. of the US Navy, Starfleet simplified its system to just NX and NCC, with the caveat that NX prototypes could be re-designated as NCC if and when the ship entered operational service (a la *Excelsior*).\n\nAs a result, between 2161 and the early 2320s, only NCC and NX numbers were counted towards Starfleet’s official registry number stream, which started at NX-01 and counted up to about NCC-10000 over the course of about 160 years (which averages out to about 60 ships per year). Meanwhile, a civilian Federation agency, akin to today’s FAA, maintained a parallel but separate number stream for registering non-Starfleet vessels, usually with registries like NAR and NST. Then, in the 2320s, that civilian agency was folded into Starfleet’s registry office and from that point on, all Federation vessels - civilian and Starfleet alike - drew their registries from a single stream of numbers, with Starfleet applying the appropriate prefix code based on the ship’s intended purpose. NX-25001 might be Starfleet’s newest and most advanced prototype starship, while NAR-25002 might be a run of the mill automated freighter making the run from Earth to Vulcan and back.\n\nThis is a far more pedestrian theory to explain prolific registry numbers than the Reserve Surplus policy, and with none of the diplomatic intrigue. But it offers a nice way to explain the rise in a way that will never come up in conversation between two Starfleet officers in the middle of an hour-long drama. It can also be used to illuminate the evolving nature of the Federation itself over time. In other words, the Federation starts as a self-defense focused military pact among otherwise sovereign nations, a la NATO. They maintain a common defense force - Starfleet - but most other operations, including the mundanities of civilian vessel registration, stay with the individual planetary governments. But over time, the Federation evolves from a NATO-esque setup into a more federalized government with more centralized operations. And part of that evolution is things like civilian vessel registration eventually being folded into an appropriate federal agency.\n\nAnd depending on where your vision of the Federation/Starfleet falls on the idealistic/cynical spectrum, you can tie Reserve Surplus and SRRA together to varying degrees. You can say that the two policies were unrelated and only coincidentally happened to occur at about the same time. Or you can say that Starfleet used the latter as cover for the former. Personally, my head canon is that they had separate origins and the timing was a coincidence, but that advocates of Reserve Surplus used the timing as part of their argument on how “hiding” the extra registry numbers in plain sight was feasible.\n\n# Extra Special Bonus Theory: The 2350s Fleet Modernization Program\n\nBecause even when used in tandem, both theories can't explain an inconsistency with the ships first seen in *First Contact* (Akira, Norway, Steamrunner) and chronological registries. The *First Contact* ships have 5xxxx and 6xxxx registry numbers, meaning that under a chronological system, they must precede ships that we have seen long before them (Galaxy, Nebula, Defiant, Intrepid). The conventional wisdom that these ships were started in response to the Borg threat in 2366 (which we know canonically does include the Defiant) cannot be true if they have 5/6xxxx numbers and the *Defiant* has a number of 74205. So, this is my workaround:\n\nBy the reckoning of my spreadsheet, 5/6xxx registry numbers would be ordered in the late 2340's and into the 2350's, which puts them solidly post-Narendra III. So in the late 40's into the 50's, the Admiralty probably realized that after a certain point, no matter how many were on tap, 100 year old *Miranda* and *Oberth* designs would only be viable assets for so long. And with peace with the Klingons solidifying into something truly stable, Starfleet decided it could start populating the fleet with newer, more combat capable designs without risking a war. Thus, the ships intended to replace the earliest reserve ships started being designed in the 2350s and started populating the reserve fleet by the 2360s. However, they remained intended as assets mostly tied to the Reserve Surplus fleet and therefore - at least to some extent - were Starfleet's ace in the hole for military action. For this reason, they remained largely unseen until called upon for that purpose - namely the Battle of Sector 001 and the Dominion War. They weren't used in the Cardassian Wars because Starfleet didn't need them. They could fend off the Cardassians without revealing their advanced new ships. And they didn't pull them for Wolf 359 because there was only a few days notice, not enough time to reactivate a significant number of mothballed ships.\n\n# Caveats:\n\nUnfortunately, with even all of these theories worked together, there's still some data points we have to disregard, but I think they're mostly production mistakes and things that are clearly retconned by other sources:\n\n* USS Yamato NCC-1305-E: Unequivocally a production mistake as confirmed by Okuda.\n* Excelsior/Nebula USS Melbourne (NCC-62043): Another clear production mistake, the result of miscommunication between \"Best of Both Worlds\" and \"Emissary.\"\n* The 8xxxx \"Conspiracy\" registries: Clearly these were never meant to be readable during broadcast. I'm surprised they weren't redone for TNG-R, but alas they weren't. Ultimately, I don't see how we can reconcile these registries when we know for a fact there is a ship class that started being developed after this point but still has a lower registry (Defiant NX-72405) and thus, just have to toss them.\n* USS Prometheus NX-59650/NX-74915: Another production mistake, the result of lack of coordination between VFX and set design teams. Here maybe we can say the multi-vector assault mode nature of the prototype has something to do with the presence of two space frame numbers.\n* Constitution-class ships below NCC-1700: Without USS *Constellation* (NCC-1017), we could write off the others as non-canon. But *Constellation* nixes that answer. My solution here is that on rare occasion, a ship may be ordered as one class, but later held over to be built as another class. So in this case, the Constellation (and maybe Eagle, Republic, etc.) were first ordered as some other class, but then held over and reassigned as Constitution. I use *Asia*\\-class to fit with Masao Okazaki's and Bernd Schneider's work, but you can use whatever you like.\n\nSo, there you have it. In what I hope is true Daystrom fashion, I present these absurdly detailed conjectures to explain exceptionally minor aspects of a TV show’s production. The Reserve Surplus theory I do intend to eventually use as the premise for an eventual storyline on our [show](http://starshiptempest.com/), probably something like:\n\n\"When ships in Starfleet’s secret surplus fleet begin mysteriously self-destructing, the *Tempest* must discover the culprit and stop any further destruction before the important strategic resource is lost entirely.\"\n\nThough that's still a fair way down the road from now.","author_fullname":"t2_6eu6b355","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"The Reserve Surplus Policy: A Theory on How to Combine a Small Starfleet With Large DS9 Battles (Plus an Extra Bonus Theory!)","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/DaystromInstitute","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_jamy57","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1,"author_flair_background_color":"","subreddit_type":"public","ups":2,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":2,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":"CmdEnsign","author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1602653434,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.DaystromInstitute","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I’m running a Star Trek RPG campaign with some friends of mine that is also a &lt;a href=\"http://starshiptempest.com/\"&gt;podcast/audio drama&lt;/a&gt;. It’s set in the Lost Era about 25 years before the start of TNG, so to get a sense of what the right registry numbers would be for the time period, I created this &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPkpJCW0FgjV_8k8girwhVpk25U-pLrt/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; and plotted out the registries over time from the founding of the Federation up through the 2380s, making sure they conformed to all known canon instances and - as much as possible - licensed non-canon instances as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can play around with it yourself by adjusting the different factors: Addition (how many ships were ordered each year), the fleet’s overall attrition rate (which would include all types of ships removed from active service - destroyed, lost, retired, decommissioned, etc.), and the number of UFP member worlds and sectors of space (I assume that the UFP adds about one member or protectorate every year and one sector of territory every other year).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the process of putting this together, I developed a theory (actually two) about why the registry numbers skyrocket between the TOS and TNG eras. First, some assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each starship receives a unique number with one of several predetermined prefixes (NX, NCC, NAR, NST, etc.), which combine to form that starship’s registry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No starships are ever assigned the same number (with one very notable exception and that one gets a letter suffix). For example, there would never be one ship with the registry NCC-74656 and another with NST-74656.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Registry numbers are assigned sequentially (we’ll refer to this as the “registry number stream” moving forward).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Registry numbers are assigned when a starship is ordered by Starfleet Command, not when its construction starts, finishes, when it&amp;#39;s launched, officially commissioned, or any other event.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The time between when a starship is ordered and when it’s launched (if it’s ever launched at all) can vary greatly depending on several factors, including but not limited to:\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A prototype versus a standard design&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The number of ships ahead of it in the ordering queue&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other logistical factors, etc. For example, the TNG Tech Manual mentions six Galaxy space frames that were started but intentionally left half completed for an indeterminate period of time. These space frames would’ve received registry numbers at the time they were ordered, even though the ships may not have entered service until several years after the fact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The rate of registry number increases starts to rise dramatically sometime around 2320 (based on &lt;a href=\"http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/articles/registry-chart2.gif\"&gt;this analysis&lt;/a&gt; by Ex Astris Scientia).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My Theory:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the early 2320s, Starfleet realized something fairly simple, though not necessarily immediately obvious: its main bottleneck in the maximum fleet size it could field didn’t have anything to do with how quickly or how many ships it could build. Not by the amount of raw materials available for construction, by construction time needed, or the throughput capacity of its shipyards. In fact, the upper limit on Starfleet’s capacity for fielding ships was not related to ship production at all. Instead, it was how quickly it could train new officers and crew to staff those starships. Since the Federation had already unequivocally turned away from genetic and cybernetic enhancement, the lowest logistical ceiling was the four years needed to train an officer to a minimum proficiency. And then another 10-15 years at least to train that officer to a command ability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Starfleet also knew that someday the unthinkable was bound to happen - someday, somebody would launch a large scale invasion of Federation space. Whether it would be the Klingons, Romulans, the recently encountered Cardassians, or some as yet unknown species, Starfleet couldn’t guess. But it knew that this was an eventuality it had to be prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in the early 2320s, they decided to simultaneously both prepare for and create a deterrence for that eventuality by building a surplus of starships that would essentially go straight into mothballs, but which could be reactivated and pressed into service in as little as a few days. Starfleet would start steadily building a tactical advantage that would only grow stronger over time. From that point forward, Starfleet started running all of its shipyards at 100% capacity at all times, despite knowing full well that this would create ten times or more as many ships as they had officers to crew them. They were mostly tried and true designs: Mirandas, Excelsiors, Oberths and most of them, upon completion, were quietly flown to any number of a hundred different surplus yards spread across the entirety of Federation space. Whereupon they were powered down and stripped of their dilithium crystals, torpedo inventories, and phaser coils.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Shelby says in &lt;em&gt;Best of Both Worlds&lt;/em&gt; that they’ll have the fleet back up and running in less than a year, she doesn’t mean they’re going to build 40 ships from scratch and launch them all within that time. She means that they’re going to dip into the Reserve Surplus - reactivate them, reassign officers to staff them, and have them filling the holes in the deployment profile that Wolf 359 left behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further, when the Dominion War breaks out, Starfleet suffers continuous heavy casualties for months - hundreds of ships are damaged or destroyed in the war’s early days. And that’s even before we ever see the 1000+ ship battles that the &lt;em&gt;Defiant&lt;/em&gt; later participates in. We can reconcile this with a “small” Starfleet by supposing that the bulk of those ships were being reactivated from surplus yards and staffed as quickly as possible, but that they were not on active operational duty prior to being pressed into combat. It also explains why there are so many &lt;em&gt;Miranda&lt;/em&gt;-class in the Dominion fleets. It&amp;#39;s not because the bulk of Starfleet is &lt;em&gt;Miranda&lt;/em&gt;-class, it&amp;#39;s because the bulk of the Reserve Fleet is &lt;em&gt;Miranda&lt;/em&gt;-class, because that&amp;#39;s what was politically viable when the Reserve Fleet first started taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This can also help explain the Enterprise-E’s absence for the visible parts of the Dominion War - if the DS9 fleets were largely made up of Reserve Surplus ships, then that lessens the need for otherwise “regular” starships to be present in those fleets. It makes more sense why a ship like the Enterprise-E would continue in her normal operations while there are these great assemblages of fleets otherwise fighting in coordinated campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Galaxy-class ships we see in DS9’s fleet battles are probably an exception to this rule and are likely active-duty ships that serve as the nuclei to groups of Reserve Fleet ships (i.e. Galaxy wings 9-1 and 9-3), much the way aircraft carriers serve as the nuclei of modern day naval carrier groups.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objection 1&lt;/strong&gt;: But then why doesn’t Shelby explicitly mention the Reserve Surplus when she talks about rebuilding the fleet? How does it never come up during all the conversations between characters during the Dominion War?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s true that the general existence of the policy would be hard to keep a secret, especially once war time actually came. To limit that liability, Starfleet officers would be explicitly discouraged from discussing the details and specifics of it - something which only admirals, their adjutants, and maybe some captains would do only when absolutely necessary. For your run of the mill officer that ends up assigned to that ship, they would only really be aware of the fact that they’ve been assigned to the &lt;em&gt;USS Lee&lt;/em&gt; (NCC-31450). If it ever even occurred to them to be curious about the ship’s service history, official records might only say something terse and generic like “Reactivated from Reserve Status on Stardate 50534.1.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objection 2&lt;/strong&gt;: But how can it be a secret at all when there are hundreds of starships flying around with 7xxxx registry numbers painted on their hulls, plain as day? Why wouldn’t they use some separate registry stream or no registry at all to hide the reserve fleet’s existence?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I imagine that when the Reserve Surplus policy was first proposed and then committed to, more than one admiral asked this exact question. And to avoid the problem, the admirals seriously considered giving the surplus ships a different registry code format, which would limit the rise of registry numbers in the regular service ships the other powers were likely to encounter. But ultimately, they decided against it to avoid some thorny diplomatic issues that would result:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starfleet prides itself on its multi-role mission. It doesn’t make warships and science ships. It makes starships, which are supposed to be able to serve either function. Giving the Reserve Fleet a distinctive registry code format would’ve been a tacit admission of its more cynical purpose - that those ships really were built and stored solely for the purpose of waging war. Even though the Federation would never use such a resource for a preemptive invasion, its potential enemies wouldn’t be so trusting, and they might then have used the special registry code as evidence of Starfleet’s hostility (the term “secret invasion fleet” would undoubtedly be thrown around). So, in the end and to avoid diplomatic objections, Starfleet kept its deceptively straightforward chronological number scheme and let starships fly around with registry numbers that gave the game away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even though it may have been the policy’s original impetus, these ships weren’t meant for just defense against invasion. They were ultimately meant to be drawn upon for any purpose and therefore, they had to be as capable of fulfilling all of a starship’s potential mission profiles as any other ship. And their registries, the Admiralty decided, should reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of which combined to create a situation where the Reserve Surplus policy became paradoxically both one of Starfleet’s most closely guarded secrets and an open secret among all of the great powers of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, by the 2330’s, the other powers started noticing the rapid rise in starship registry numbers. And when they started extrapolating those numbers, they quickly realized there were hundreds and then thousands of ships they weren’t seeing. At first, they weren’t sure where they were or what they were doing. Space is, after all, quite a big place and no spacefaring power has the ability to effectively surveil the entirety of another power’s territory. When accused, Federation diplomats feigned ignorance. When confronted with evidence, they neither confirmed nor denied anything and the consistent registry format kept that denial credible, if not believable. But in all that was unspoken, a very clear message was sent: the Federation will never seek war. But if pressed, it was prepared for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Klingons provide an illustrative and perhaps the most important example of how this deterrence worked in practice. At the policy’s inception, peace with the Klingons was still a relatively new situation. The Federation wanted to maintain that peace and build upon it, but at the same time, it also needed to be prepared in case that peace failed. The Reserve Surplus policy accomplished the second goal at the cost of the first. The Admiralty feared that the Klingons might even decide it constituted an invasion fleet and use that as justification in attacking first. In the wake of Praxis, had the Klingons started that war, they would’ve lost it. But the Federation avoids wars, even when it can win them. But even so the Federation couldn’t fully trust the Klingons to honor that peace, the bad blood running too deep for too long. By building the Reserve Surplus and using familiar designs like the &lt;em&gt;Miranda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Oberth&lt;/em&gt;, as well as keeping them within the same registry scheme as operational starships, Starfleet was able to walk a fine line of being prepared for war without outright courting it. And, in part because of the deterrence created by the Reserve Surplus policy, war with the Klingons never came (though of course there were other factors, the most significant being the sacrifice of the &lt;em&gt;Enterprise-C&lt;/em&gt;, which began to genuinely sway Klingon public opinion towards the Federation in a way that no other outreach had been able to do).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even despite their general knowledge of it, the Reserve Surplus was not enough to dissuade the Cardassians from going to war. They poured the majority of their economy into their war efforts once the conflict kicked into high gear in the 2350s. And for ten years, the Cardassians produced as many ships as they could as fast as they could, strip mining both their own planet and those of annexed territories like Bajor in the process. But despite a single minded focus on military superiority, they simply could not overcome the seemingly inexhaustible supply of replacement ships that Starfleet was able to field. Whenever the Cardassians managed to destroy a starship, it was replaced within weeks, sometimes days. Nonetheless, the Cardassians were relentless in their efforts. Where Klingons on the battlefield might be summed up with the word “ferocity” or Romulans with the word “cunning”, Cardassians could be summed up with the word “tenacity.” For ten years and with an uncommon single-mindedness, the Cardassians threw their focused might on defeating Starfleet and acquiring Federation territory. And though they made some little gains here and there, the Reserve Surplus policy created a logistical wall that they simply could not breach, to the point where Starfleet was able to demobilize from a war footing a full three years before the Cardassians did. Eventually, even they realized that the pursuit of such gains at Starfleet’s expense was an ultimately futile effort, paving the way for an eventual armistice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objection 3&lt;/strong&gt;: But if the bottleneck is trained officers, that still doesn’t explain how Starfleet staffs those ships when war does come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is true. So let’s stretch this theory a bit further and also use it to explain the officer/enlisted situation. We know that enlisted crew ranks exist, but seem to be extraordinarily rare compared against present day militaries. Gene Roddenberry may at one point have had a vision of a Starfleet with only officers, but that’s now patently contradicted by on screen evidence, Miles O’Brien being the most substantial example (but others existing as well, like Crewman Tarses).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So how do we reconcile this? This is how:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In peace time, Starfleet maintains an officer corps with at least four years of training, usually from Starfleet Academy, and enough to fully staff a “small” fleet for exploratory, humanitarian, and defensive patrol missions. In peacetime, this mostly suffices. Starfleet also maintains a small corps of enlisted personnel, but this is mostly just to retain the institutional memory of how to train and field enlisted personnel at all. In peace time, enlisted ranks make up a very small percentage of overall Starfleet personnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But should Starfleet have to transition into a wartime footing, it can use that institutional memory to rapidly train tens of thousands of enlisted crewmembers in the bare essentials of starship operations within the span of a few months. As Starfleet mobilizes for war, it activates its Reserve Surplus fleet and spreads out its Academy trained officer corps over the entirety of Starfleet, with enlisted personnel filling up the bottom ranks of operations. The enlisted crewmember takes the station that would normally go to a newly commissioned ensign (or even a Starfleet Academy cadet on field training).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(we&amp;#39;ll leave aside the question of where these extra bodies come from, whether the Federation would institute a draft or in some other way compel a larger percent of the population to participate in war making. I think it&amp;#39;s an interesting question and one I&amp;#39;d like to explore at some point, but I don&amp;#39;t have any formed thoughts at the moment)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In peacetime, that ensign might be the low-person on the operations department totem pole, scrubbing plasma conduits on a long serving starship without anyone under their supervision. But in wartime, that same ensign might find their first assignment is onboard an activated Reserve Surplus ship, overseeing one or more enlisted personnel with three to six months of department-specific training, much more similar to how current-day militaries function. Starfleet doesn’t consider it an ideal situation, preferring its personnel to be more well rounded. But it’s an acceptable compromise to make in order to wield the most effective fighting force possible, as long as that compromise is a temporary one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(we can also use this theory to put one more notch into Ensign Kim’s butt monkey status - had he commissioned just a bit later, he would’ve done so into a Starfleet mobilized for the Dominion War. Whereupon he might’ve been immediately in charge of some amount of enlisted personnel. Even if he was still just an ensign, at least he wouldn’t have been at the absolute bottom of the ladder. But alas, poor Harry missed it by &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the conflict concludes and Starfleet is able to demobilize from a wartime footing, most of those enlisted personnel are deactivated along with the Reserve Surplus ships they staffed. Some few may choose to stay in the service and almost all of those go through further training to become commissioned officers. Some exceedingly few may choose to stay in the service but not go through officer training and become non-commissioned officers. This is how we explain Chief O’Brien: he originally enlisted as part of the Cardassian Wars and was able to rise at least as far as Tactical Officer on a &lt;em&gt;New Orleans&lt;/em&gt;-class ship. After Starfleet demobilized (though before the official armistice was signed), he chose to stay on but also chose not to transition into a commissioned officer, perhaps one of only a very few to do so. From what we know of him, we can surmise he liked the opportunities to work on interesting machinery, but never had any interest in commanding a starship or one of its departments, and thus never applied to the Academy before enlisting nor pursued an officer’s commission following the war. To remain a Tactical Officer/Chief of Security would&amp;#39;ve required becoming a commissioned officer and department head. He didn&amp;#39;t care about any of that, so he moved to transporters and was perfectly content there until an opportunity came along to work on an even more interesting engineering challenge - cobbling together a monstrosity of Starfleet and Cardassian technology. The attraction of that challenge might&amp;#39;ve overwhelmed his aversion to becoming a department head with people under his command.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So my supposition is that enlisted crewmen are uncommon but not rare, but if one stays in Starfleet long enough, the natural course is to go through officer training and receive a commission. One has to make an active choice to stay in Starfleet for an extended period of time but remain an NCO rather than become an officer, making NCOs legitimately rare. This is based on the observation that we have only seen two Chief Petty Officers in all of Star Trek: Miles O&amp;#39;Brien and Sergey Rozchenko, both of whom expressed an explicit preference to remain enlisted rather than become officers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Special Bonus Theory: The Starship Registration Reorganization Act&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even with this theory, we’re still talking about an awful lot of ships - between one and two thousand every year for decades upon decades. So, I actually have a second theory on registry numbers that I use in tandem with the Reserve Surplus theory. Though it’s much duller and doesn’t offer any of the diplomatic intrigue that the Reserve Surplus theory does, it does do yeoman’s work in lifting the yearly average. And it’s not really linked to the Reserve Surplus theory by necessity, so you can feel free to take either one and leave the other if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also in the early 2320s, the Federation Council passed into law the Starship Registry Reorganization Act, significantly altering how registry numbers were managed and folding the administration of vessel registry, civilian and Starfleet, under one common office and therefore, into one stream of registry numbers. Starfleet, as we all know, serves a broader role than just military or defense and in practice probably handles many of the duties that a present day government’s “alphabet soup” of offices does. To draw a parallel to present day organizations, Starfleet is both the Navy and NASA. But beyond that, it’s also the Coast Guard, NOAA, and probably the FAA, NTSB, CTB, ATF, DEA, and several others.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the 20th/21st century United States, the Navy assigns hull numbers to Navy vessels while the Coast Guard maintains registries for civilian vessels. Similarly, the various service branches assign tail codes to their own aircraft while the FAA assigns and manages tail numbers for all civilian aircraft. But if all of the future versions of these disparate offices fall under the general umbrella of Starfleet, then it makes sense that those individual functions would also be consolidated into a single office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(in real life, you apply for the tail number you want and the FAA gives it to you if available. But we’ll dispense with that part in this analogy, both to keep the sequential registry framework intact and to avoid the prospect of starship vanity plates. Instead, we’ll say that if you’re building a starship for non-Starfleet purposes, Starfleet just hands you the next number in the stream)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So in this construct, prior to the 2320s, Starfleet maintained a simple stream of numbers that they applied only to their own ship registries. And since each vessel was supposed to be all purpose - in theory capable of both exploration and defense - they dispensed with type-specific registry codes and kept only a distinction between prototype and operational vessels. In other words, instead of the BB-62, CVN-65, SSN-688, etc. of the US Navy, Starfleet simplified its system to just NX and NCC, with the caveat that NX prototypes could be re-designated as NCC if and when the ship entered operational service (a la &lt;em&gt;Excelsior&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, between 2161 and the early 2320s, only NCC and NX numbers were counted towards Starfleet’s official registry number stream, which started at NX-01 and counted up to about NCC-10000 over the course of about 160 years (which averages out to about 60 ships per year). Meanwhile, a civilian Federation agency, akin to today’s FAA, maintained a parallel but separate number stream for registering non-Starfleet vessels, usually with registries like NAR and NST. Then, in the 2320s, that civilian agency was folded into Starfleet’s registry office and from that point on, all Federation vessels - civilian and Starfleet alike - drew their registries from a single stream of numbers, with Starfleet applying the appropriate prefix code based on the ship’s intended purpose. NX-25001 might be Starfleet’s newest and most advanced prototype starship, while NAR-25002 might be a run of the mill automated freighter making the run from Earth to Vulcan and back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a far more pedestrian theory to explain prolific registry numbers than the Reserve Surplus policy, and with none of the diplomatic intrigue. But it offers a nice way to explain the rise in a way that will never come up in conversation between two Starfleet officers in the middle of an hour-long drama. It can also be used to illuminate the evolving nature of the Federation itself over time. In other words, the Federation starts as a self-defense focused military pact among otherwise sovereign nations, a la NATO. They maintain a common defense force - Starfleet - but most other operations, including the mundanities of civilian vessel registration, stay with the individual planetary governments. But over time, the Federation evolves from a NATO-esque setup into a more federalized government with more centralized operations. And part of that evolution is things like civilian vessel registration eventually being folded into an appropriate federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And depending on where your vision of the Federation/Starfleet falls on the idealistic/cynical spectrum, you can tie Reserve Surplus and SRRA together to varying degrees. You can say that the two policies were unrelated and only coincidentally happened to occur at about the same time. Or you can say that Starfleet used the latter as cover for the former. Personally, my head canon is that they had separate origins and the timing was a coincidence, but that advocates of Reserve Surplus used the timing as part of their argument on how “hiding” the extra registry numbers in plain sight was feasible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Extra Special Bonus Theory: The 2350s Fleet Modernization Program&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because even when used in tandem, both theories can&amp;#39;t explain an inconsistency with the ships first seen in &lt;em&gt;First Contact&lt;/em&gt; (Akira, Norway, Steamrunner) and chronological registries. The &lt;em&gt;First Contact&lt;/em&gt; ships have 5xxxx and 6xxxx registry numbers, meaning that under a chronological system, they must precede ships that we have seen long before them (Galaxy, Nebula, Defiant, Intrepid). The conventional wisdom that these ships were started in response to the Borg threat in 2366 (which we know canonically does include the Defiant) cannot be true if they have 5/6xxxx numbers and the &lt;em&gt;Defiant&lt;/em&gt; has a number of 74205. So, this is my workaround:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the reckoning of my spreadsheet, 5/6xxx registry numbers would be ordered in the late 2340&amp;#39;s and into the 2350&amp;#39;s, which puts them solidly post-Narendra III. So in the late 40&amp;#39;s into the 50&amp;#39;s, the Admiralty probably realized that after a certain point, no matter how many were on tap, 100 year old &lt;em&gt;Miranda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Oberth&lt;/em&gt; designs would only be viable assets for so long. And with peace with the Klingons solidifying into something truly stable, Starfleet decided it could start populating the fleet with newer, more combat capable designs without risking a war. Thus, the ships intended to replace the earliest reserve ships started being designed in the 2350s and started populating the reserve fleet by the 2360s. However, they remained intended as assets mostly tied to the Reserve Surplus fleet and therefore - at least to some extent - were Starfleet&amp;#39;s ace in the hole for military action. For this reason, they remained largely unseen until called upon for that purpose - namely the Battle of Sector 001 and the Dominion War. They weren&amp;#39;t used in the Cardassian Wars because Starfleet didn&amp;#39;t need them. They could fend off the Cardassians without revealing their advanced new ships. And they didn&amp;#39;t pull them for Wolf 359 because there was only a few days notice, not enough time to reactivate a significant number of mothballed ships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Caveats:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, with even all of these theories worked together, there&amp;#39;s still some data points we have to disregard, but I think they&amp;#39;re mostly production mistakes and things that are clearly retconned by other sources:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;USS Yamato NCC-1305-E: Unequivocally a production mistake as confirmed by Okuda.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excelsior/Nebula USS Melbourne (NCC-62043): Another clear production mistake, the result of miscommunication between &amp;quot;Best of Both Worlds&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Emissary.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The 8xxxx &amp;quot;Conspiracy&amp;quot; registries: Clearly these were never meant to be readable during broadcast. I&amp;#39;m surprised they weren&amp;#39;t redone for TNG-R, but alas they weren&amp;#39;t. Ultimately, I don&amp;#39;t see how we can reconcile these registries when we know for a fact there is a ship class that started being developed after this point but still has a lower registry (Defiant NX-72405) and thus, just have to toss them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;USS Prometheus NX-59650/NX-74915: Another production mistake, the result of lack of coordination between VFX and set design teams. Here maybe we can say the multi-vector assault mode nature of the prototype has something to do with the presence of two space frame numbers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Constitution-class ships below NCC-1700: Without USS &lt;em&gt;Constellation&lt;/em&gt; (NCC-1017), we could write off the others as non-canon. But &lt;em&gt;Constellation&lt;/em&gt; nixes that answer. My solution here is that on rare occasion, a ship may be ordered as one class, but later held over to be built as another class. So in this case, the Constellation (and maybe Eagle, Republic, etc.) were first ordered as some other class, but then held over and reassigned as Constitution. I use &lt;em&gt;Asia&lt;/em&gt;-class to fit with Masao Okazaki&amp;#39;s and Bernd Schneider&amp;#39;s work, but you can use whatever you like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. In what I hope is true Daystrom fashion, I present these absurdly detailed conjectures to explain exceptionally minor aspects of a TV show’s production. The Reserve Surplus theory I do intend to eventually use as the premise for an eventual storyline on our &lt;a href=\"http://starshiptempest.com/\"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;, probably something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When ships in Starfleet’s secret surplus fleet begin mysteriously self-destructing, the &lt;em&gt;Tempest&lt;/em&gt; must discover the culprit and stop any further destruction before the important strategic resource is lost entirely.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though that&amp;#39;s still a fair way down the road from now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?format=png8&amp;s=f8ba22b1d40a2fb51976f99f8a6b1b18e6c4b623","width":539,"height":315},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=3cf581535f948fab4d983076a12c1323a62894f8","width":108,"height":63},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=52eef6383ea78af6114672be4007c5a6fefe1e66","width":216,"height":126},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=png8&amp;s=bb485f8647334c2a5d3a5872f4e0d65b94a528fd","width":320,"height":187}],"variants":{"gif":{"source":{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?s=efe5ebbcd2932a330b0b6a2b78269f601a58c9c1","width":539,"height":315},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;s=7f82e251ab4652d9e31923dc7e183d5b1576c53a","width":108,"height":63},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;s=c038c571482bfc0bb1aec5de2dfaffb13e73594a","width":216,"height":126},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;s=8ed9065d99a6b2dd23214d2c48b3c3871d231c3b","width":320,"height":187}]},"mp4":{"source":{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=9693c3bf9cd85df990c98c9c0f61b9879f155708","width":539,"height":315},"resolutions":[{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=108&amp;format=mp4&amp;s=01476667d3c30fc8cc11c16c5c6c553c3c9735ca","width":108,"height":63},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=216&amp;format=mp4&amp;s=b3cce0c153fed7e42d3611cfab71b1d741264246","width":216,"height":126},{"url":"https://external-preview.redd.it/55v-V8CvaXe-hcw44mETb5ODEy91OzWiqWt8vu-Mcpw.gif?width=320&amp;format=mp4&amp;s=f5916575bf8dbe3a2be80c9026e2198d2bd3e34a","width":320,"height":187}]}},"id":"OyaLL5dOfZJdK7UgtsZ4q7Jh6jtbsdSTpiqyDPZUunU"}],"enabled":true},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":"Ensign","treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2whek","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"jamy57","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"starshiptempest","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","permalink":"/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/jamy57/the_reserve_surplus_policy_a_theory_on_how_to/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/jamy57/the_reserve_surplus_policy_a_theory_on_how_to/","subreddit_subscribers":68416,"created_utc":1602624634,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"buildapcforme","selftext":"&gt;**What will you be doing with this PC?

I always wanted to become a game programmer, but I'm starting to doubt that choice. I really think that doing what is fun to you heavily outwheighs the slightly worse industry and salaries, but maybe it would be way too greedy of a goal in my situation. Maybe it will be all much easier if I choose a path with more job opportunities. The problem is that I'm not quite sure what else I'm interested in. I love programming in general, and I love math, but I'm not sure how it would feel to do work a more \"traditional, boring office job\". I know for sure I hate frontend with passion, but everything else is a mystery to me. Data science/engineering sounds amazing, but I hear it's difficult to get into it without a masters degree - and I'm sure as hell not getting one myself. I don't know how I feel about the other options... backend? Embedded? Mobile apps? Not sure if I'm particularly into any of those. I might be, though, I'm just not sure. \n\n**1.TLDR;** I don't know if game programming is worth it, or even possible in my situation, and I'm not sold on any other areas. Thoughts?\n\n**2)** Let's say I make my decision about (1). How do I even build a portfolio? To land a job when I graduate I'll need to have gone through a nice internship. To land an internship I'll need a nice portfolio. But what is a nice portfolio? Let's suppose I'm almighty and have unlimited time in my hands: where do I start? Do I look for an internship as fast as possible? Do I work on personal projects? Do I join a professional team working on something? Do I focus on open source projects? If I really wanted to bring great value to my CV and blow competition out of the water, what is the goal I should have to make that possible? Given that I'm capable, what could I possibly do that would wow interviewers? How do I maximize my chances of success?\n\n**2.TLDR;** What's test way to build an impressive portfolio and increase my chances of success?\n\nSorry if I sound too confused and clueless, it's cause I really am. It's the kind of thing that I'd never learn in university and would need to gamble in life to learn from. Any advice is highly welcome.

I love programming in general, and I love math, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how it would feel to do work a more &amp;quot;traditional, boring office job&amp;quot;. I know for sure I hate frontend with passion, but everything else is a mystery to me. Data science/engineering sounds amazing, but I hear it&amp;#39;s difficult to get into it without a masters degree - and I&amp;#39;m sure as hell not getting one myself. I don&amp;#39;t know how I feel about the other options... backend? Embedded? Mobile apps? Not sure if I&amp;#39;m particularly into any of those. I might be, though, I&amp;#39;m just not sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t know if game programming is worth it, or even possible in my situation, and I&amp;#39;m not sold on any other areas. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;#39;s say I make my decision about (1). How do I even build a portfolio? To land a job when I graduate I&amp;#39;ll need to have gone through a nice internship. To land an internship I&amp;#39;ll need a nice portfolio. But what is a nice portfolio? Let&amp;#39;s suppose I&amp;#39;m almighty and have unlimited time in my hands: where do I start? Do I look for an internship as fast as possible? Do I work on personal projects? Do I join a professional team working on something? Do I focus on open source projects? If I really wanted to bring great value to my CV and blow competition out of the water, what is the goal I should have to make that possible? Given that I&amp;#39;m capable, what could I possibly do that would wow interviewers? How do I maximize my chances of success?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.TLDR;&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;#39;s test way to build an impressive portfolio and increase my chances of success?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if I sound too confused and clueless, it&amp;#39;s cause I really am. It&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that I&amp;#39;d never learn in university and would need to gamble in life to learn from. Any advice is highly welcome.
