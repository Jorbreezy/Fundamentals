I want to work with a provider to ensure that whatever I do isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; (not out of their playbook) and needs &amp;quot;correction&amp;quot; (ie, bring it into a standard-for-them supportable configuration) before they&amp;#39;ll take on my business.  I need this partner as I am unwilling to take complete ownership over the functionality of the entire network like my predecessor volunteer did (strangely, he&amp;#39;s really hard to get a hold of.  I blame him not at all.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like Ubiquiti makes local, certified (?) support companies in my area easy to find.  Am I missing something? Is there a directory I am overlooking?  Can someone give me a local referral? I&amp;#39;d really like to get moving on this but I have been frustrated in finding a good partner to move forward with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TIA for any help or recommendations that can be provided.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2ub3z","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"jam3l3","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"blckgrffn","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":1,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/Ubiquiti/comments/jam3l3/looking_for_support_smb_partner_for_a_ubiquiti/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/jam3l3/looking_for_support_smb_partner_for_a_ubiquiti/","subreddit_subscribers":76923,"created_utc":1602622052,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"learnpython","selftext":"I'm a high school student who's interested in programming, but my school doesn't have too many options for it.","author_fullname":"t2_5kzugkcx","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Anyone know of any affordable online courses to get college credit forpython?

My plan after I graduate is to take a gap year and look for one or two more research or clinical opportunities in order to beef up my resume (and take the GRE as well).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From what I have seen most neuropsychologist have PhDs, however some opt for a PsyD instead. Are there any advantages or disadvantages for opting for a PsyD with a focus on neuropsychology? My assumption is that I have a better chance of getting into a PsyD program than a PhD.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"780442a8-66bf-11e9-bd8e-0e83bb778612","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2rhda","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#007373","id":"jaly95","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"HDHD112","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":1,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/Neuropsychology/comments/jaly95/psyd_in_neuropsychology/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Neuropsychology/comments/jaly95/psyd_in_neuropsychology/","subreddit_subscribers":65832,"created_utc":1602621589,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}}],"before":null}}
